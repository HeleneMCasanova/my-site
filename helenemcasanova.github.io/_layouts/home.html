        <p id = "dec-name" >Helene Casanova</p>

        <p>I am a student, a programming enthusiest, a writer, an innovator and mostly a self-starter. This is my work,
          programming is my life and writing is my passion (a very time consuming one). Overall, I wanted a place to
          display what I work so hard on everyday and what I continue to work on, whether it be book I write, the programs
          I've written or the new hobby I've started. </p>
          <p>I'm always working on something new. My passion is computer security, cryptography and pen testing.
          Everyday, I do something to further my knowledge on these subjects through books, online courses, writing
          the actual programs and testing. I am a true audodidact.</p>
          <p>I'm am also writing the next book in "The Journals" series set to be comleted by the middle of May 2018. I
            am also working on a secret project known only as PROJECT: PURPLE and is set to take me a little
            longer to complete than one of my regular books.</p>
